## FrontEnd
Made in Angular, with help of material UI.
Autmatically will be working on port 4200 with ng serve

## FrontEnd
for the backend I have used node with express, PRisma as an ORM and postgres as a DB

## How to start it
If you want to run the app you will need postgres, and an .env file 
with a the secret for the cookie sessions, the postgres url and the port of the 
express server.
