## Frontend
Made in Angular, with help of material UI.
Autmatically will be working on port 4200 with ng serve.

## Backend
for the backend I have used node with express, PRisma as an ORM and postgres as a DB

## How to start it
First do npm init on the client folder and the server forlder to install the dependencies.
then for the backend you will need postgres, and an .env file 
with a the secret for the cookie sessions, the postgres url and the port of the 
express server.
